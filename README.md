# Tic-Tac-Toe AI with Minimax Algorithm

A web-based tic-tac-toe game featuring an unbeatable AI opponent powered by the minimax algorithm.

## âœ¨ Features

### ðŸ§  **Intelligent AI**

- **Unbeatable AI**: Implements the minimax algorithm for optimal gameplay.
- **Perfect Strategy**: AI will never loseâ€”it will either win or force a tie.
- **Instant Decision-Making**: Real-time move calculation and response.

### ðŸŽ® **Enhanced Gameplay**

- **Player Choice**: Choose to play as X (first) or O (second).
- **Move History**: Track all moves with a detailed history panel.
- **Game Timer**: Real-time elapsed time tracking for each game.
- **Game Statistics**: Persistent win/loss/tie tracking stored locally.

## How It Works

The AI uses the **minimax algorithm**, a decision-making algorithm that:

- Explores all possible game outcomes.
- Assumes both players play optimally.
- Chooses moves that maximize the AI's chances while minimizing yours.
- Guarantees the AI will never lose (it will either win or tie).
